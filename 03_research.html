              <h6>I. platform real estate.</h6>My dissertation explores the
              spatialization of digital real estate platforms. That is, how do new technologies for the management, transaction, surveyance and surveillance of real estate transform how we come to own the earth—and, perhaps more importantly, who
              gets
              to own it?<br> <a href="https://itspangler.github.io/proptech/" target="blank">Learn more here</a>.

              <h6>II. short-term rentals.</h6>I have longstanding interests in short-term rental platforms and their relationships to the lived experiences of gentrification. Drawing on <a target="blank"
                href="https://www.mediapolisjournal.com/issues/platform-urbanism/">contemporary writing</a> about platform urbanism, <a target=blank href='https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tran.12367'>my research into
                short-term
                rentals</a> shows how they facilitate feelings of "displacement in place"—and why that can actually be good for platforms like Airbnb.

              <h6>III. sweat.</h6>Inspired by the <a target="blank" href="http://www.politicalecology.org/node/121">Sweat Geographies Collective</a>, I've recently become fascinated with how sweat has been constiuted as an object of medical
              inquiry. Current trends in sweat sensing technology, which blur the lines
              between medical devices and consumer goods, call into question: how does sweat "matter" in the age of ubiquitous computation?
