          <p>My name is <b>Ian Spangler</b> and I am a <b>geographer, writer, and cartographer</b>. I work as <a target="blank" href="https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/ian-spangler/">Assistant Curator of Digital & Participatory Geography</a> at the Leventhal Map & Education Center. Since 2018, I've also been pursuing my PhD in Geography at the <a target="blank" href="https://geography.as.uky.edu/users/itsp222">University of Kentucky</a>.</br>
            <br>In my scholarly work, I examine how digital technologies mediate our experiences of the places where we live. I've previously studied gentrification, emotional labor, and short-term rentals in New Orleans. My dissertation work explores the <b>design and use of digital real estate platforms</b> in Boston and New York.</p>
          <p>I'm originally from outside of Richmond, VA. I'm fond of chess, though I'm not all that good at it. I dislike fluorescent lighting, and am a morning person, but only at night. I nourish my soul with artisanal memes about <em>Twin Peaks</em>, sea shanties, and
            <em>Dungeons & Dragons</em> every Friday night.
